# Data Science Course Repository

Welcome to the repository for our comprehensive Data Science Course! This course is designed to equip you with the foundational skills necessary to embark on a career in data science, including statistical analysis, data cleaning and transformation, machine learning, and data visualization. The course will begin from a cybersecurity perspective, and then branch out into other areas later on. 

## Course Description

In this course, you will learn the end-to-end process of analyzing data through practical, hands-on projects. We will cover the following key areas:

- **Introduction to Data Science**: Learn what data science is and why it's important in today's world.
- **Statistics for Data Science**: Grasp the basics of statistics and how it applies to data analysis.
- **Programming for Data Science**: Get up to speed with Python/R, the primary languages used in data analysis.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Understand how to prepare your data for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Learn how to create meaningful visual representations of your data.
- **Machine Learning**: Dive into basic and advanced machine learning techniques.
- **Capstone Projects**: Put your skills to the test with real-world projects.

## Modules

Each module in this course is contained in its own directory:

- `01_Introduction`
- `02_Statistics`
- `03_Programming`
- `04_Data_Cleaning`
- `05_Data_Visualization`
- `06_Machine_Learning`
- `07_Capstone_Projects`

Inside each directory, you will find the following:

- Lecture notes and slides
- Jupyter notebooks with coding exercises
- Datasets used in exercises and projects
- Additional resources and reading materials

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have a basic understanding of:

- High school level mathematics
- Some experience with programming (preferably in Python or R)

## Installation and Setup

To follow along with the course exercises and projects, you will need to set up your environment. Instructions for installation of the necessary software (like Python, R, Jupyter notebooks) and libraries (like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) can be found in the `installation_guide.md`.

## How to Use This Repository

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Follow the installation guide to set up your environment.
- Begin with the first module and progress sequentially.
- Complete the exercises and quizzes at the end of each module.
